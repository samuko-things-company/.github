Checkout My Key Projects:
* [**Easy PID Motor Controller**](https://github.com/samuko-things-company/epmc_documentation) - An Easy-to-use PID Motor controller for controlling geared DC motors (with quadrature encoders) via angular velocity commands rather than the traditional PWM commands.
* [**Easy IMU**](https://github.com/samuko-things-company/eimu_documentation) - An Easy-to-use advanced IMU system that offers easy calibration and Madgwick filter setup, ensuring you get filtered orientation readings with easy integration into your preferred project.
* [**Mobo Bot**]() - An educational differential drive mobile robot for learning mobile robotics in **ROS2**. It uses the [Easy PID Motor Controller](https://github.com/samuko-things-company/epmc_documentation) and the [Easy IMU](https://github.com/samuko-things-company/eimu_documentation) for its base control.
